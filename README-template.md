## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Hover Effects
- Mobile Version

### What I Learned

I learned how to structure a card component effectively, incorporating hover effects and a responsive mobile version to enhance user experience. I used the **BEM methodology** to organize HTML, ensuring a clean and maintainable structure. Additionally, I applied **Flexbox** for layout management, added **hover effects** to improve interactivity, and used a **media querie** to create a responsive design suitable for mobile devices.

### Useful Resources

- [BEM Methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - This resource provided a clear explanation of the BEM methodology, which I found invaluable for organising and structuring HTML in a clean and maintainable way. It made the process of creating well-structured, reusable components much easier.
  
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - An excellent game that made learning Flexbox both fun and intuitive. It helped solidify my understanding of Flexbox layout techniques and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to grasp this concept in an engaging way.
